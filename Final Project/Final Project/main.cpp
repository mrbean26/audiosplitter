// Comments on Finishing the Project

	1. I would consider using a slightly larger network and frequency resolution to comprimise efficiency for quality

	2. If I was to publish the product I would make display scaling much more accurate, to support several aspect ratios

	3. I would offer an option for efficiency or quality, to choose wether you want better speed or quality
